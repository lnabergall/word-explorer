Python program, including a tkinter GUI, to calculate arbitrary pattern indices and word distances of double occurrence words.

To start the GUI, run interface.py in the command-line. Words are input via a text entry box or from a text file via the File menu for batch processing. 
The calculations are output in the Output box and can be saved by selecting "Save Output" and inputting a full text file name (including extension).
To calculate the distance between two words, enter the two words separated by a comma and a space in the text entry box (e.g. "121323, 1212").
