The **operations API** provides functions for working with operations on words involving the insertion or deletion of a pattern instance.

**insertions** - Contains functions for generating insertions and testing for an insertion relation between two words. Run 'python insertions.py' from the terminal to use the latter functionality.

**reduction_flipping** - Contains functions for constructing reductions and reverse reductions and testing whether a given path can be 'flipped' (see docstrings for clarification of the notion of path 'flipping').

**io** - Input/output functions.
