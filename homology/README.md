The **homology API** provides functions for computing and storing the homology groups of a word graph for a given set of maximal simplices. 

**word_graph_homology** - The high-level interface for computing the homology groups of a word graph, given subgraph types to be considered as maximal simplices.

**io** - Input/output functions for the homology API, including tools for retrieving maximal simplices and storing homology data.
