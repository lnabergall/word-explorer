The **homology API** provides functions for computing and storing the homology groups of a word graph for a given set of maximal simplices. 

**word_graph_homology** - The high-level interface for computing the homology groups of a word graph, given subgraph types to be considered as maximal simplices. Based upon an included set of modules from https://sourceforge.net/projects/triangleinequal/files/Graph%20Theory/ that contain tools for generating and analyzing simplicial complexes and their homology.

**io** - Input/output functions for the homology API, including tools for retrieving maximal simplices and storing homology data.
